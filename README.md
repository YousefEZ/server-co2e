# On Site Servers Carbon Footprint

This is a compiled list of carbon footprints compiled from various sources used for carbon footprint calculations if you are thinking about buying an on-site server. If you wish to add more servers to the list, feel free to issue a pull request.

**kg CO2e w/o use** (kg. CO2 equivalent) is the total carbon footprint for the manufacture, transport and various other carbon emissions that is not related to the actual use of the server.

**kg CO2e w/ use** is the total carbon footprint expected after 4 years of use.
